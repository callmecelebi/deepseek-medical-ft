A Foley catheter was placed in the operating room and removed in the post-anesthesia care unit. He receives subcutaneous heparin and has sequential compression devices in place to prevent deep venous thromboses. On post-operative day 1, he develops suprapubic pain and dysuria and is subsequently found to have a urinary tract infection. He is discharged on post-operative day 2 with an appropriate antibiotic regimen. However, he presents to the emergency room on post-operative day 6 with severe left leg pain. Venous dopplers demonstrate an occlusive thrombus in the popliteal vein. He is readmitted for anticoagulation and monitoring. A quality improvement team in the hospital estimates that the probability of getting both a urinary tract infection and a deep venous thrombosis is 0.00008 in patients undergoing routine total knee replacement. Furthermore, they estimate that the probability of getting a urinary tract infection in a similar patient population is 0.04.

The baby is born vaginally weighing 1.2 kg (2.64 lb). Because he does not cry immediately after birth, endotracheal intubation is attempted to secure the airway. However, the vocal cords cannot be visualized because there is only a single opening corresponding to the esophagus. He is transferred to the NICU under bag and mask ventilation, where intubation is attempted once again by passing the endotracheal tube in the visualized opening, after which his oxygen saturation begins to improve. His temperature is 37.0ºC (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, and respiratory rate is 42/min. On physical examination, no abnormalities are noted. Chest radiography is suggestive of respiratory distress syndrome. Which of the following most likely failed to develop in this patient??",

The mother reports that her favorite “game” is to repetitively flex and extend the neck of a doll, which she always keeps with her. She is sensitive to loud sounds and starts screaming excessively when exposed to them. There is no history of delayed motor development, seizures, or any other major illness; perinatal history is normal. When she enters the doctor’s office, the doctor observes that she does not look at him. When he gently calls her by her name, she does not respond to him and continues to look at her doll. When the doctor asks her to look at a toy on his table by pointing a finger at the toy, she looks at neither his finger nor the toy. The doctor also notes that she keeps rocking her body while in the office. Which of the following is an epidemiological characteristic of the condition the girl is suffering from??",

This type of headache (that mostly affects men) is characterized by excruciating pain on 1 side of the head. After careful randomization and controlling for all of the known confounders, a total of 200 patients with cluster headaches were divided into 2 groups. The first group of study participants received 40 mg of the new drug, X, in the form of a powder mixed with water. The second group received 80 mg of verapamil (a calcium channel blocker that is commonly prescribed for cluster headaches) in the form of a labeled pill. Participants from both groups were mixed together in rooms designated for drug research purposes and could communicate freely. After the study period has finished without any loss to follow-up or skipped treatments, the outcome (pain alleviation) was assessed by trained researchers that were blinded to treatment assignment. Study results have shown that the new drug is more efficacious than current gold standard by both clinically and statistically significant margin. Therefore, the investigators concluded that this drug should be introduced for the treatment of cluster headaches.

Researchers conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group (14.4%) and 554 deaths in the placebo group (16.7%, p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).\nWhich of the following represents the number of patients needed to treat to save one life, based on the primary endpoint??",
